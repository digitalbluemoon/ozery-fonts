How to use:
-

Everything is pulled through the RawGit's CDN, based on the files hosted in this GitHub repo.

You can add the stylesheet <code>< link ></code> in the <code>< head ></code> of your webpage / website OR you can just <code>@import</code> the CDN URL of the /css/fonts.css at the top of your own stylesheet. Then obviously you'll be able to use any of these fonts into your own css classes. You can get the font-family names for each font by viewing the fonts.css stylesheet.

The Permanent RawGit CDN URL is this one (to be used only on production):

https://cdn.rawgit.com/digitalbluemoon/ozery-fonts/9d0d7853/css/fonts.css

Usage Examples:
-

Ozery Bakery Favicon CDN URL: https://rawgit.com/digitalbluemoon/ozery-fonts/master/ozery_favicon.png

<pre><code>< link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/digitalbluemoon/ozery-fonts/9d0d7853/css/fonts.css" ></code></pre>

OR

<pre><code>@import 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/digitalbluemoon/ozery-fonts/9d0d7853/css/fonts.css';</code></pre>


Then you can define your own classes and use the font-family you need:

<pre><code>
.example_class1 {
	font-family: 'sini_bold';
	font-size: 18px;
}

.example_class2 {
	font-family: 'brandon_grotesque_black';
	font-size: 22px;
}
</code></pre>
