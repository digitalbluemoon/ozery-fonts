# Ozery Webfonts

To be used on Ozery Bakery projects @ developer: Sabin A. Dologa

Most of the webfonts are bought by the client (licenced). I aquired them from the client's website or were generated with fontsquirrel.com, based on the original non-web ones. They are located in the /fonts folder.

A Demo Page with all the fonts can be found in index.html

Included webfonts:
-

Sini Bold, Sini Bold Italic, Sini Ornament

HalisR Light, HalisR Medium
